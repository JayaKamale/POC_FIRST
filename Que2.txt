Question 2 :
Concept of method implementation

Write a program to create ‘Square’ and ‘Rectangle’ class.
i. Implement methods to calculate area and perimeter of square and rectangles. 
These two methods are going to take side as argument in square and length and 
breadth in case of rectangle.

ii. Create a ‘MainClass’ in which define main method ,in which create two object for 
each Square and Rectangle class, Now calculate then show area and perimeter in 
the console after providing appropriate values for side , length & breadth using 
methods of these classes.
 
Program :

class Square
{
  void calc1(int side)
	{
	  int per_of_sq = side*4;
	  int area_of_sq = side*side;
      System.out.println("Perimeter of Square is: "+per_of_sq);
	  System.out.println("Area of Square is: "+area_of_sq);
	}
}
class Rectangle
{
  void calc2(int length, int breadth)
	{
	  int per_of_rect = (length*2)+(breadth*2);
	  int area_of_rect = length*breadth;
	  System.out.println("Perimeter of Rectangle is: "+per_of_rect);
	  System.out.println("Perimeter of Rectangle is: "+area_of_rect);
	}
}
class MainClass
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		Square sq = new Square();
		sq.calc1(2);
		Rectangle rect = new Rectangle();
		rect.calc2(2,3);
	}
}

Output :
 
Perimeter of Square is: 8
Area of Square is: 4
Perimeter of Rectangle is: 10
Perimeter of Rectangle is: 6
