Program :

		Student student1 = new Student();
		student1.rollNo = 101;
		student1.name = "Sonu";
		Student student2 = new Student();
		student2.rollNo = 102;
		student2.name = "Geeta";
		System.out.println("Roll No. of Student1 is: "+student1.rollNo);
		System.out.println("Name of Student1 is: "+student1.name);
		System.out.println("Roll No. of Student2 is: "+student2.rollNo);
		System.out.println("Name of Student2 is: "+student2.name);
	}
}
